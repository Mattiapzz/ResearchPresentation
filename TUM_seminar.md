# Optimal Control, Planning, and Intelligent Vehicles

## Leveraging optimal control and sampling-based methods for motion planning in autonomous driving

### Abstract 

This presentation explores the development of local real-time planners for autonomous driving, emphasizing flexibility and robustness in diverse scenarios and applications. An urban-specialized version of the planner has been implemented within the VeDi2025 and SUNRISE projects.

The proposed planner focuses on dynamic obstacle avoidance, safety assurance, and optimization while enabling cooperation and negotiation via V2X communication. It has been tested and integrated into the commercial simulation platform IPG CarMaker and SIL testing with RTMaps and dSpace. Moreover, it was validated in real-world tests conducted in collaboration with Stellantis.

Key aspects covered include using motion primitives for trajectory planning, formulating cost functions tailored to urban and racing scenarios, and implementing an integrated negotiation strategy within a multi-objective optimization framework.

Finally, the presentation discusses the results and performance metrics, along with the challenges and limitations of the proposed approach. It will also provide an overview of future research directions and potential applications.
